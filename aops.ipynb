    "Recently, we’ve noticed some fluctuations in email marketing campaign performance. Over the last month, our campaigns have been doing very poorly compared to prior months. The leadership team has asked us a few questions about this dip in campaign performance that we’d like you to look into and recommend a course of action. We care about making decisions backed by data and want to ensure that any conclusions we make are meaningful and significant. You have been provided with a data set that contains details of different campaigns we’ve launched and various metrics.\n",
